JGravSim v1.9 beta

A program to calculate and visualize gravitational effects with relativistic
corrections!

	*JGravSim_beta.jar
	*JGravSim_text.xml
	*optional: Java3D textures

	*optional: CGravSim backend files
  Be sure that all of those files/folders in the same folder and check that 
  you have enough free space on your hard disk, as every calculation will 
  be saved to this folder!

  Additionally you can download newer cgravsim_ARCH files in order to have a
  probably faster and more accurate version of the calculation.
  The java calculation is going to be deprecated soon.
