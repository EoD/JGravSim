JGravSim v1.8 beta

A program to calculate and visualize gravitational effects with relativistic
corrections!


INSTALLATION

  Copy the JGravSim.jar and the file JGravSim_text.xml to the same folder and be
  sure that you have enough free space on your hard disk, as every calculation 
  will be saved to this folder!

  Additionally you can download the cgravsim_ARCH files in order to have the
  new (and much more accurate) version of the calculation.
  The java calculation is going to be deprecated soon.


REQUIREMENTS

  You need a Java runtime environment which is equivalent to Sun's Java SE 
  Runtime Environment 1.6 or newer.
  It is recommended to use IcedTea 6 or newer.


TROUBLESHOOTING

  If you get an error message saying that the text file is missing although it's
  there, try to launch the program in the console
	
	java -jar JGravSim.jar
